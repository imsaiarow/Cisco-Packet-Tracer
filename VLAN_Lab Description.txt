VLAN_Lab Description

1. PCs are connected to a Cisco modular switch1
2. Switch1 is connected to a router in gi0/0
3. router has another interface gi0/1 where it is connected to switch2
4. Switch2 connected to a pc16
5. PCs are in different vlans, so we created VLAN10,VLAN20,VLAN30,VLAN40,VLAN50.
6. PCs are set to Dhcp ip configuration
7. In switch1, 5 vlans with HR_DEPT,FIN_DEPT,MKT_DEPT,SALES_DEPT,IT_DEPT are created.
8. In switch1, Vlan range has been configured and configured the range in access mode.
   In switch1, interface fa0/24 is configured as trunk port , because that interface i connected to router, which                      	can be used to rroute traffic between different vlans
9. In router, subinterfaces with dot1q encapsulation is configured and vlan tagging is added.
10. In router, dhcp pool is created for 5 subinterfaces with their respective network
11. ACL is created in router, deny any traffic to network 192.168.20.0 and named as BLOCK_TO_VLAN20
12. Apply the BLOCK_TO_VLAN20 acl to gi0/0.20 subinterface as outbound rule
13. In router, gi0/1 is configured as 10.10.1.1
14. In switch2, default vlan 1 is configured with ip 10.10.1.2
15. In switch to all interfaces are configured as access port to vlan 1
16. In pc16, set the ip to dynamic
17. Try pinging from PC1 to PC16 and vice versa, it should be reachable.
18. Try ping any ip from 192.168.2.0 network , it should be denied or blocked.
